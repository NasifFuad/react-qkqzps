            Josephite Business club has returned with a 3rd installment of its
            flagship event, Josephite Entrepreneurs’ Den. This year, our motto
            is “Outclassing Obstacles”. JBC has been organizing Josephite
            Entrepreneurs’ Den since 2018 with the goal of making it the biggest
            most innovative national business event of Bangladesh. Keeping that
            in mind, the event will have 18 contests divided into 31 competitive
            segments this year. Sticking to our unique selling point of
            innovative events, we have added 5 more original segments along with
            the plethora of events you will find only at Josephite
            Entrepreneurs’ Den. These are daunting numbers during these tough
            times, but the club plans not to just overcome the problems, but to
            Outclass the Obstacles. We aspire to give the school and college
            students of Bangladesh an experience that exceeds all expectations
            of not just an online event, but its substitutes as well. We welcome
            students of all mediums, whether they are from Science, Business, or
            Humanities to have the best business competition experience of
            Bangladesh.
